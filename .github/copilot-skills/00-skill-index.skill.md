## Skill Creation Guide

When the project reaches active status and recurring tasks emerge, create task-specific skill files:

`
.github/copilot-skills/
  00-skill-index.skill.md          -- this file (always present)
  01-[task-name].skill.md          -- first recurring task skill
  02-[task-name].skill.md          -- second recurring task skill
  ...
`

Each skill file follows this structure:
`yaml
---
skill: [skill-name]
version: 1.0.0
triggers:
  - "[trigger phrase 1]"
  - "[trigger phrase 2]"
